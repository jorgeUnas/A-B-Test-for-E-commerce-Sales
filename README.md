# A/B Test for E-commerce Sales

## Project Description

I have determined the effectiveness of the new banner to increase sales using an A/B test. I recommend that we must not launch the new banner if our unique objective is to increase revenue because we did not observe strong evidence that there was an increase in revenue per user. Despite that, I have found strong evidence that our conversion rate increased in the treatment. Then, I recommend to launch our banner as an effective marketing strategy and I give some extra recommendations to improve the company’s sales.

## Context 

The GloBox’s growth team ran an A/B test with a new banner (Figure 1) aiming to promote its new category of food and drinks and increase its revenue. The control group did not perceive a difference in the app and the treatment group was exposed to the banner. These sample groups have a similar size (Control: 24343 users, treatment: 24600 users) and are stratified random samples (stratas: gender, country and mobile device). The test lasted 12 days in the first quartile of 2023 which is a reasonable period to observe any change in sales for our E-commerce company.
